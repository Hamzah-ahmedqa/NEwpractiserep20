	//what do we inherent, like in real life, we inherit things from our parents,grandparents, etc
	  //these concepts will work if you design a Parent and respective child classes
	
	//Child class inherits some of the properties of the parent class
	//Parent class does not inherent from Child class
	
	//object acquires properties/behavior of its parent object
	
	/* advantages
	 1) code reuseablity 
	 2)we can use polymorphism 
	 
	  disadvantages
	  1) classes are tightly coupled with eachother
	  2) we cannot inherit private methods, constructors, child class, ss
	 
	 3 types of inheritance 
	 1)single level
	 2)multi-level
	 3) Hierarchical  - but this isnt used
