	//methods vs Constructors
	/*
	  1)Constructors do not have a return type, not even void
	  2)The name of the constructor is the class name but methods can have any name
	  3)Constructors are invoked whenever an object is created
	  4)Methods can be inherited but Constructors cannot
	  5)Constructors cannot be static but Methods can
	  6)all Access modifiers are allowed for both
	  
	 
	 Constructors are used to initialize an object
	 Constructors are used to optimize code
	 Constructors are never used to create an objects!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	 
	 3 type of Constructors 
	 1)default C - this is invoked the moment an object is created
	 2)Parameterized C with no arguments - user Defined
	 3)Parameterized C with arguments - user defined
