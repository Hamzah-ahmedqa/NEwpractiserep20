//encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping our data into a single unit
	//why do we need to do this?
	//theres instance variables, static variables, methods
	//in encapsulation we are gathering the complete form and putting it in the same unit
	//allowing the end customer to use 
	
	//the customer knows how to drive the car and add gas, 
    //the customer doesnt know how each component is working
	
	//much like abstraction to me.
	
	//like -> eating medicine capsules, different colors
	
	
	//how to achieve encapsulation?
	/*
	  1) know the use of access modifiers 
	  2)declare the class variables as private 
	  3)create 2 methods -> setter and getter, both of those will be public [to access and modify]
	 
	  //objective make sure the internal state of the object is protected 
	   * while still allowing the external code to interact with it through a well defined interface

	//what is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?
	//the key difference is intent
	
	//abstraction means showing the required things only
	//hiding the background details
	
//	encapsulation means
	//wrapping the data and methods into a single unit
	//so the data can remain hidin, and only accessed by the properties 
	
	//abstraction is a broader concept of hiding
